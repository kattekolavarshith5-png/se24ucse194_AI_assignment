Simple Reflex Agent for Air Quality Index (AQI) Detection

Project Overview

This project implements a Simple Reflex Agent in Python that determines the Air Quality Index (AQI) of a region using environmental sensor data.

The agent reads pollution parameters from a sensor data file, evaluates them using predefined condition–action rules, and outputs the AQI value along with the air quality category.

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence agents interact with an environment using sensors and produce actions based on rules.

Environmental Parameters Used

The agent uses the following pollution parameters:

Parameter	Description
PM2.5	Fine particulate matter
PM10	Coarse particulate matter
CO	Carbon monoxide
NO2	Nitrogen dioxide
SO2	Sulfur dioxide

These values are read from the sensor data file.

AQI Categories

AQI Range	Category
0 – 50	Good
51 – 100	Moderate
101 – 150	Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups
151 – 200	Unhealthy
201 – 300	Very Unhealthy
301+	Hazardous
